# 🔍 Everything You Can Do With a Public IP Address (Detailed)

Once you’ve captured a public IP address — for example, from a WhatsApp P2P STUN packet — you unlock a wide range of both **legal** and **theoretical/offensive** techniques that are used in **penetration testing**, **red teaming**, and **network analysis**.

This document assumes you control both devices (lab setup) and are exploring purely for educational purposes.

## 🌍 1. Geolocation Techniques

### 📌 A. IP-Based Geo Lookup
- Use services like:
  - `ipinfo.io/<ip>`
  - `ip-api.com/json/<ip>`
  - MaxMind's GeoLite2 database (offline option)
- Typical Output:
  - Country, State, City, ZIP
  - Approximate GPS coordinates (very rough)
  - ISP or carrier name (e.g., Jio, Airtel, Verizon)
  - Proxy/VPN detection (if anonymization is used)

### 🌐 B. ASN and BGP Info
- Tools:
  - `whois <ip>`
  - https://bgp.he.net/<ip>
- Learn:
  - Autonomous System Number (ASN)
  - Network name and ownership
  - Peering relationships (what other networks it's connected to)

### 🕰️ C. Timezone and Locale Estimation
- From the IP’s location, deduce timezone, language, culture, holidays, etc.

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ 2. Recon & OSINT

### 🔎 A. Reverse DNS Lookup
```bash
dig -x <ip>
host <ip>
```
- Reveals PTR records, which might expose hostnames like `pool-124-50-1-21.bangalore.res.bsnl.net.in`

### 📚 B. Historical IP Analysis
- Use `viewdns.info`, `securitytrails.com`, or `dnsdumpster.com`
- See:
  - Previous domains hosted on the IP
  - DNS history / misconfigurations
  - Certificates used

### 🔍 C. Shodan / Censys Lookup
- `shodan.io` or `censys.io`
- Type the IP and get:
  - Open ports
  - Known vulnerabilities (CVE references)
  - SSL cert info
  - Historical snapshots

---

## 📡 3. Network Scanning

### 🧪 A. Nmap Basic Scan
```bash
nmap -Pn <ip>
```
- Identifies open TCP ports even when ping is blocked

### 🔍 B. Version Detection & Banners
```bash
nmap -sV <ip>
nc <ip> 80
curl -I http://<ip>
```
- Extracts software versions (e.g., Apache/2.4.7, OpenSSH 7.6p1)

### 📊 C. UDP Scan (often ignored but valuable)
```bash
nmap -sU <ip>
```
- Detects DNS, SNMP, NTP, SSDP, and other UDP services

---

## 🧬 4. Fingerprinting

### 🧬 A. TTL Analysis
- Ping the IP:
```bash
ping <ip>
```
- TTL clues:
  - Windows = 128
  - Linux = 64
  - Routers = 255

### 🧬 B. TCP/IP Stack Fingerprinting
```bash
nmap -O <ip>
p0f -i eth0
```
- Learn:
  - OS type and version
  - Uptime estimate
  - NAT behavior

---

## 🎯 5. Service Enumeration & Vuln Hunting

### 📥 A. Web Interfaces
- If HTTP(S) found, look for:
  - `robots.txt`, `/.git`, `/admin`
  - Outdated CMS or router panels
  - Use tools like `whatweb` or `nikto`

### 🔐 B. SSH/FTP/RDP/SMB Testing
- Weak credentials
- Anonymous login
- SMB null shares
- CVEs like EternalBlue (SMBv1)

### 🧨 C. IoT/Router Exploits
- Port `7547` (TR-069) often exploited in routers
- Port `1900` (SSDP) for reflection/amplification
- Port `81`, `8000`, `8080` for exposed panels

---

## 📈 6. Traffic Inspection & Analysis

### 🗣️ A. Capture RTP or STUN Data
- Look at UDP traffic in Wireshark
- Identify ICE candidates (direct IPs)
- Extract call metadata (packet sizes, intervals)

### 📶 B. NAT Type Detection via STUN
- Full Cone = easily reachable
- Symmetric = harder to reach
- Use this to assess potential for P2P hole punching

---

## 🧠 7. Behavioral & Identity Clues

### 🎭 A. WebRTC Leaks (Browser)
- If phone opens malicious JS site:
```js
RTCPeerConnection().getLocalCandidates()
```
- Reveals LAN and WAN IPs

### 🎯 B. JS Fingerprinting Techniques
- Gather:
  - OS, browser, battery %
  - Device model (from canvas/audio fingerprinting)
  - Locale and timezone

---

## 🛠️ 8. Persistence, Mapping & Tracking

### 🕰️ A. IP Change Monitoring
- Set up a cronjob or script to ping or `curl` the STUN IP response every 10 min

### 🧠 B. Associate IP with User Activity
- Correlate IP with:
  - Login attempts to accounts
  - Behavioral patterns (online time, language usage)

---

## 🔥 9. Red-Team/Illegal (THEORETICAL)

### ❌ A. Traffic Flooding (Illegal)
- SYN flood, ICMP flood, UDP flood
- Can overwhelm NAT routers or 4G modems

### ❌ B. Exploit Delivery (Advanced)
- If you NAT punch successfully, attempt RCE payloads
- Example: Exploiting a vulnerable SIP/VoIP service
